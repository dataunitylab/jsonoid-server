# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until the 1.0 release, we will not provide patches for old minor versions in the case of a security vulnerability.
Patches will be made available for the latest minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any potential security vulnerabilities should be [reported privately](https://github.com/dataunitylab/jsonoid-server/security/advisories/new).
We will aim to acknowledge all submitted reports within 72 hours and provide a fix where necessary as soon as possible.
